In response, the U.S. Army deploys three of its special operations forces ‚Äì 75th Rangers, Delta Force counter-terrorist operators, and 160th SOAR - Night Stalkers aviators ‚Äì to Mogadishu to capture Aidid, who has proclaimed himself president of the country.\r\n","To consolidate his power and subdue the population in the south, Aidid and his militia seize Red Cross food shipments, while the UN forces are powerless to intervene directly. Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force capture Osman Ali Atto, a faction leader selling arms to Aidid's militia. A mission is planned to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid's top advisers.\r\n","The U.S. forces include experienced men as well as new recruits, including 18-year-old PFC Todd Blackburn and a desk clerk, SPC Grimes, going on his first mission.

The Somali militia erects roadblocks, and LTC Danny McKnight's Humvee column is unable to reach the crash area while sustaining heavy casualties. Meanwhile, two Ranger Chalks, including Eversmann's unit, reach Super-Six One's crash site and set up a defensive perimeter to await evacuation with the two wounded men and the fallen pilots. In the interim, Super Six-Four, piloted by CWO Michael Durant, is also shot down by an RPG and crashes several blocks away.\r\n","With CPT Mike Steele's Rangers pinned down and sustaining heavy casualties, no ground forces can reach Super Six-Four's crash site nor reinforce the Rangers defending Super Six-One. Two Delta Force snipers, SFC Randy Shughart and MSG Gary Gordon are inserted by helicopter to Super Six-Four's crash site, where they find Durant still alive. The site is eventually overrun, Gordon and Shughart are killed, and Durant is captured by Aidid's militia before the angry mob of Somali civilians can kill him as well.\r\n","McKnight's column relinquish their attempt to reach Six-One's crash site and return to base with their prisoners and the casualties. The men prepare to go back to extract the Rangers and the fallen pilots, and MG Garrison sends LTC Joe Cribbs to ask for reinforcements from the 10th Mountain Division, including Malaysian and Pakistani armored units from the UN coalition.\r\n","As night falls, Aidid's militia launch a sustained assault on the trapped Americans at Super Six-One's crash site. The militants are held off throughout the night by strafing runs and rocket attacks from AH-6J Little Bird helicopter gunships, until the 10th Mountain Division's relief column is able to reach and save the American soldiers.

Clem finds the activity harmless enough, until one day he finds drugs in the latest coffin. Clem objects and tells his girlfriend, Ellie, that he will quit after one last job that night, the looting of a warehouse. Narcy betrays him, triggering the burglar alarm while he is inside. Clem manages to get back in the car with Narcy and another member of the gang, Soapy, before they drive off. When Narcy orders Soapy to run down a policeman, Clem grabs the wheel in an unsuccessful attempt to save the man's life and the car crashes into a lamppost.

Mrs.Fenshaw then tries to get Clem to shoot her husband, stating that as he is already a murderer it won't make any difference to him.

She encounters the aptly named Stoney (Jack Nicholson) and his hippie band \"Mumblin' Jim\" in a coffee shop. The boys are sympathetic, especially when they discover that she is deaf and can only understand others through lip reading. They hide her from the police and help her look for her brother. She has a postcard from him which reads \"Jess Saes: God is alive and well and living in a sugar cube\". The band is approached by a promoter who arranges for them to perform at \"the Ballroom\", clearly the Avalon Ballroom or the Fillmore West.\r\n","Artist Warren (Henry Jaglom), who designs the psychedelic posters advertising the band, freaks out badly in his gallery, apparently on STP. He sees everyone, including himself, as walking dead and tries to cut off his own (to him festering) hand with a circular saw. While they help him, Jenny notices a large sculpture resembling abstract flames in a corner and recognizes it as her brother's work. The gallery owner says the artist is known as \"The Seeker\", an itinerant preacher. Ex-band member Dave (Dean Stockwell) may know The Seeker's current whereabouts.\r\n","Dave left the band because he felt they were too concerned with worldly success and \"games\", rather than serious focus on music for its own sake. His information leads the gang to a junkyard. Nearby is a sign reading \"Jess Saes\" -- \"Jesus Saves\", with some letters missing. The \"sugar cube\" slogan is painted on the side of a car which Jenny recognizes as her brother's. However, a group of thugs who frequent the junkyard accost the group. They have it in for The Seeker. They dislike his street preaching and his themes of love and peace (perhaps they are Vietnam War veterans). They threaten to rape Jenny. Violence ensues, and the group barely escape with their lives.\r\n","Jenny's friendship with Stoney has become sexual. She does not know his reputation for one-night stands and lack of commitment. She attends a mock funeral staged by a large group of hippies, with background music by The Seeds; the theme of their play is that death is not the end, and that love and a refusal to hurt others are what keep us alive. In Stoney's crowded home, everyday hippie life is less than ideal. The residents are all involved in contemplation, sex, sleeping, dancing, or decorating, but little cleaning or maintenance. Jenny tries to wash the mountain of dishes in the kitchen and finds that the plumbing is broken, but everybody just continues dancing. Frustrated, she interrupts Stoney's band practice to inform him she is going to take a walk. He answers angrily that he has no leash on her. Dave, sitting quietly in the next room, is distressed at the way Stoney treats Jenny. Concerned in spite of himself, Stoney later goes to find her. He ends up at the art gallery, where he hears breaking glass and slips inside.\r\n","The Seeker (Bruce Dern) has returned to the art gallery to pick up his sculpture. Challenged by Stoney, he pleads that the work should not be touched; it is actually not art, but a shrine. He believes that God spoke to him and asked him to create the piece. He is glad Jenny is looking for him, but says he is on drugs and wants to be sober when they meet. Jenny's deafness is pathological; their mother was cruelly abusive, and burned Jenny's beloved toys. Jenny was violently traumatized and apparently had a stroke; she was deaf from that moment.\r\n","The performance at the Ballroom is a success; Mumblin' Jim play, along with the Strawberry Alarm Clock. Steve the Seeker shows up, hoping to see Jenny, but the junkyard thugs are also present and chase him back to his home. Steve runs right behind Jenny without her noticing, since she hears nothing. At an after-show party Dave remonstrates Stoney over his ambition for commercial success, as well as his cavalier treatment of Jenny. Stoney saunters off with another woman, and Dave consoles Jenny. She sees him put STP in some fruit juice. He offers himself to her, but Stoney charges in and angrily shouts at Jenny, calling her a \"bitch\". Heartbroken, Jenny accepts Dave's glass of fruit juice and drinks nearly all of it.\r\n","She again explains her search for Steve, and Dave pulls a note from his pocket: \"God is in the flame,\" and an address. Jenny runs out and takes a streetcar. Stoney rouses Dave, now tripping on STP, to help find her. Pursued by the junkyard thugs back to his home, Steve lights a fire inside his shrine. Soon the entire house is ablaze. Jenny arrives to find a crowd gathering near the house; she runs in just in time to see him standing in the middle of the flames, absorbed in prayer; he sees her, but merely smiles and waves.\r\n","In her grief and confusion, she runs up to the roof, hallucinating wildly. She apparently jumps into a reservoir. She then sees fire bombs heading towards her barely missing her. Gary Kent, the film's stunt coordinator, did double duty creating this and other special effects in the film. [3] She is standing in the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge, cars coming at her from both directions with their horns blaring. She has her hands over her ears, indicating perhaps that she has regained her hearing. Dave and Stoney find her. Dave shoves her out of the way of an oncoming car and is struck and killed. As he dies, he murmurs that he hopes this, too, will be a good trip. Sickened and angry, Jenny tries to leave, but Stoney embraces her. The film ends with the two holding each other and crying, while an image of the mock funeral reappears.\n","\n","-------------------------------------------\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"1e5f134c08e84e7eb2eadb4c78178f38","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"58378e7168314b7bbee8d0a8ee61794d","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","True Genre:     thriller\n","\n","Predicted Genre: thriller\n","\n","Plot: Chyna Shepherd accompanies her friend Laura Templeton to her house for Thanksgiving dinner.

As a captive, Chyna speaks with Vess and has flashbacks to her traumatic childhood: as a little girl, she witnessed her disturbed, abusive mother and her boyfriend kill her grandparents. In turn, Vess reveals his obsession with the \"intensity\" of any particular experience and declares his intention to kill both her and Ariel, but offers Chyna a slightly more merciful death if she agrees to aid him in mentally torturing Ariel out of her catatonia.\r\n","When Vess finally leaves for work, Chyna seizes the opportunity to free herself and Ariel. After dressing in Vess's dog-training gear and spraying ammonia in the eyes of his bloodthirsty Dobermans, Chyna attempts to flee with Ariel in Vess's mobile home, but unwittingly triggers an alarm that causes him to return home early.\r\n","Before they can make their escape, an unmarked vehicle and a police car arrive. Although Chyna believes Vess to be in the unmarked vehicle driven by Trevaine, it is revealed that Vess is actually a State Trooper who emerges from the police car and opens fire on Trevaine, killing him before turning his attention to the mobile home. Chyna and Ariel manage to escape back to Vess's house, where Chyna ultimately gets the better of Vess. She sets him on fire, locks him in Ariel's old room, and watches as he burns to death.\r\n","In the aftermath, Chyna visits Ariel in a psychiatric hospital but is denied custody of her in a hearing; she is told that the young girl will require extensive therapy to recover from her trauma. As Chyna prepares to leave without her, Ariel, speaking for the first time, suddenly calls out to her the name \"Badger\", a character from a story Chyna had told her about to help bring her courage while escaping from Vess.

Dogen shoots down the bike and finds one of Syn's crystals on the pilot's body. Carved into the crystal is a symbol of a dead tree. Dogen next finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana (Kelly Preston) saw him killed by Baal (R. David Smith), Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana that it's his mission to find Syn and she joins him.\r\n","Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax (Marty Zagon) who tests the crystal and identifies it as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor.\r\n","On the way Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by an attacking group of vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off, and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn attempts, but fails, to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong. Dogen awakes, but Dhyana is suddenly teleported away and a summoned monster appears in her place and fires electric bolts at him. Dhyana simultaneously faces Syn in his lair. Dogen uses water to short-out the creature and it vanishes.\r\n","Dogen arrives in Zhor and finds Rhodes (Tim Thomerson), a washed-up soldier, in a bar. Rhodes denies the lost city's existence and refuses to get involved. Dogen leaves and comes upon a group of miners beating a captured nomad soldier. Dogen runs to help him, the miners turn hostile, and a shootout ensues. Dogen is out-gunned until Rhodes helps him defeat the miners.\r\n","Rhodes reluctantly agrees to help Dogen. They drive deep into Cyclopian territory and come to the lost city. Dogen locates a large statue with a single eye and finds the crystal mask the legend foretold. Suddenly attacked by snake-like creatures, they escape, until they are accosted by a group of nomad warriors. Their leader Hurok (Richard Moll) grabs the mask from Dogen and accuses them of trespassing on their sacred land ‚Äì a crime punishable by death. Rhodes cites nomad law stating that a warrior can fight for his freedom, so Dogen is put into a dueling pit with Hurok. Dogen defeats him and spares his life. Hurok accepts Dogen as a friend and lets him go free.\r\n","Dhyana is being held in Syn's lair. Syn takes her before a massive crystal and forces her to touch it. It begins to glow and emits a sound like the suffering of hundreds of beings. Syn tells her the crystal gets its power from the souls he captures, including that of her father. Dhyana, disgusted, says her warrior will come for her.\r\n","Elsewhere, Dogen and Rhodes assault Baal's encampment and a chase ensues. Dogen evades them, and stops to rest at a lake. Dogen looks over the mask, then places it over his face and finds himself in the dream world with a burning tree. In his hand he finds an axe and hacks into the tree. The tree moans like the crystal in Syn's camp and trickles a stream of blood. Dogen pulls the mask off his face and finds himself back with Rhodes. Suddenly, they are attacked by Baal, who rushes up extending his robotic arm to spray Dogen, but Rhodes pushes him out of the way and is knocked out, and Dogen, struggling with Baal, rips the robotic limb from his shoulder. Baal cries out in agony and flees. Dogen follows the trail of green fluid leaking from Baal's severed limb, tracking it into Syn's camp. He sees the nomads gathered around Syn and makes his way through the crowd. Hurok is also present and steps forward to greet him.\r\n","Syn announces that the warrior is here to stop the people from achieving their goals, but Dogen states that he has only come for Syn. Syn orders Hurok to kill Dogen but Hurok refuses and demands that Dogen be allowed to speak. Dogen tells the nomads that Syn is a liar who wants their land so he can enslave them. The crowd murmurs with anger, but Syn shouts they are all too late. He activates the crystal and summons a blast of energy which stuns the crowd. Syn fires more blasts at Dogen, but he deflects them with the mask. Baal grabs the mask and it shatters on the ground. Hurok seizes Baal and stabs him in the chest with a knife. Syn shouts in despair as his son dies, then suddenly teleports himself away. Dogen hears the sound of a skybike and sees Syn fly off. He jumps onto another skybike and chases Syn over the mountains and into the desert, but Syn casts another spell, opening an energy portal, and he escapes.\r\n","Dogen returns to the nomad camp, finding Dhyana safe with Hurok. Dogen says Syn has escaped, and Hurok states that he may return in another place and time. Dogen swears he will be waiting for him, and destroys Syn's soul crystal with his pistol.

Suddenly, he arrives, bedraggled and exhausted, and begins to describe the strange experiences he has had since the group last met.\r\n","At their earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George described time as \"the fourth dimension\" to David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp. He shows them a small model time machine and asks a guest to press a tiny lever. The device disappears, validating his claim, but his friends remain unconvinced; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal.\r\n","George bids his guests a good evening, then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future to 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in a War. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping in 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \"a new war\"; George resumes his journey and stops in 1966, finding his neighborhood now part of a futuristic metropolis. People are hurrying into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover. Moments later, a nuclear explosion causes a volcanic eruption around him. George narrowly makes it back to his machine and continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly cools and hardens, trapping him inside. He travels much farther into the future until the rock eventually erodes away, revealing a lush, green, unspoiled landscape.\r\n","When George stops once again it is 802,701 and he is near the base of a towering sphinx. He goes exploring and finds a group of delicate young men and women with simple clothing gathered at a stream. One woman, carried off by the current, screams for help but none of her companions show any concern. George rescues her and is surprised when, revived, she walks away without a word; she later seeks him out and gives him a flower. She says her name is Weena and tells George her people are called the Eloi. The Eloi do not operate machines, work, or read, and know little of mankind's history.\r\n","That night, George discovers that his machine has been taken into the sphinx. Weena follows, telling him \"Morlocks\", who only come out at night, have moved it. A Morlock jumps out from behind bushes and tries to drag her away, but its light-sensitive eyes are blinded by George's fire torch. Weena has never seen fire before and nearly burns herself trying to touch the flame.\r\n","The next day, Weena shows George domed, well-like structures that dot the landscape: air shafts that double as access to the Morlock underworld. She takes him to an ancient museum where \"talking rings\" tell of a war in the distant past which lasted 326 years. A reduced population fought for survival in the poisoned landscape; many decided to live underground in permanent settlements, while some returned to the surface. George realizes this was the beginning of speciation for the Morlocks and the Eloi. He starts to climb down a shaft, but stops when sirens blare from atop the sphinx. He finds Weena gone and crowds of Eloi in a trance-like state, entering open doors at its base. The sirens stop and the doors close.\r\n","George enters the Morlocks' subterranean caverns and is horrified to see that the Eloi are the free range livestock for the Morlocks; the Morlocks are cannibals. Finding Weena, he begins fighting the Morlocks. His efforts inspire others to defend themselves. George sets fires and urges the Eloi to climb to the surface with him. He directs them to gather dry tree branches and drop them down the shafts. The fire's intensity increases and the subterranean cavern collapses.\r\n","The next morning, George finds the sphinx in charred ruins and its doors open. His time machine is inside. He enters, the doors close, and George is attacked in the dark by Morlocks. George activates his time machine, traveling back to 1900, coming to rest on the lawn outside his home, where the story had begun, and now ends.\r\n","As the bedraggled George recounts his story, his friends are again skeptical. He produces Weena's flower and Filby, an amateur botanist, says that he cannot match it with any species known in the 19th century. George bids his guests a good evening. Filby steps out but returns to find George and his time machine now gone. There are drag marks which indicate that George wanted the time machine to be positioned outside the sphinx when he returned to the future. The housekeeper notes that nothing is missing except three books that she could not identify. When the housekeeper wonders if George will ever return, Filby observes that he could not say but that \"he (George) has all the time in the world\".\n","\n","-------------------------------------------\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"deab07625db04dc4998f850b19b0182c","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"9cb1faf2c5b94858a92b6cefe49b80c5","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","True Genre:     musical\n","\n","Predicted Genre: romance\n","\n","Plot: Berke Landers and his girlfriend Allison were the quintessential high-school couple who grew up together and eventually fell in love, but she breaks up with him immediately after the film begins. This leads to an opening musical number of \"Love Will Keep Us Together\" by Captain & Tennille, imagined by Berke. He seeks advice from his embarrassing parents Frank and Beverly Landers, who are hosts of a relationship advice show called Love Matters, but they don't help with the situation and constantly focus on his sex life and sexuality throughout the film. Allison then starts a relationship with Striker, a 'foreign' student who was once the lead singer of a boy band called the Swingtown Lads. When Allison and Striker audition for the school's upcoming musical, Berke desperately tries to win Allison back by also auditioning for the play, despite having no theatrical talent and having a busy schedule as a member of the basketball team. Meanwhile, Berke's friends Felix and Dennis try to find a new girlfriend for him.\r\n","With the help of Felix's younger sister, Kelly, a talented songwriter and singer, Berke wins a minor role in the play, a modern musical version of Shakespeare's comedy A Midsummer Night's Dream called A Midsummer Night's Rockin' Eve, written and directed by the school's domineering drama teacher, Dr. Desmond Oates. Striker plays Demetrius, Allison plays Hermia, Kelly plays Helena, and Lysander is to be played by the school's star actor, Peter Wong. But after Peter is injured in a freak accident, Striker nominates Berke to take over the role of Lysander, and, still intent on winning Allison back, Berke accepts. He gradually improves with continuing assistance from Kelly, but remains unaware of the growing attraction between the two of them. While searching through props backstage, Kelly accidentally shoots Berke in the arm with an arrow gun, thinking it's a prop. Meanwhile, Oates blames Kelly's singing for his own poorly written song and rejects her suggestions to improve it.\r\n","Felix and Dennis set Berke up on a date with Dora a very attractive but accident-prone woman. The date ends horribly when Dora inadvertently causes a fire in the restaurant. They try again by taking him to a strip club. However their attempts fail when Burke is locked into a harness and whipped by a dominatrix named Mistress Moira. The night ends with the club being raided by the police, Felix and Dennis abandoning Berke who is then picked up by his parents who, to Berke's shock, congratulate him.\r\n","At a party at Berke's house, Kelly kisses Berke, but he insists that a relationship between them could not work because she is Felix's sister. She leaves him, annoyed at his unwillingness to move on with his life, and Felix, coming across the two, punches Berke. At the same party, Berke and Allison catch Striker cheating on Allison with her best friend Maggie (Zoe Saldana), and so Allison breaks up with Striker. Meanwhile, Frank and Beverly return home to the party and once again congratulate Berke. Berke lampoons them for constantly embarrassing him and not acting like normal parents would to these types of situations.\r\n","On the play's opening night, the first half of the performance goes smoothly except for some onstage scuffling between Berke and Striker. During the intermission, Allison confides to Berke that she wants to get back together with him, leaving him with a difficult choice between her and Kelly. Meanwhile, Striker bribes two of the theater technicians to try and blow up Berke using stage pyrotechnics. Before the play resumes, Felix gives the orchestra sheet music for a love ballad written by Kelly to replace Oates' unpopular tune.\r\n","After the curtain rises, Kelly sings her song so beautifully that Berke is reminded of their time together and finally realizes he loves her. As the fourth act begins, he abandons his lines from the script and makes up his own verse professing his character's love for Kelly's character Helena. The audience applauds as Berke and Kelly kiss. Striker protests this change, but unwittingly signals the technicians to set off the explosion, blowing him offstage. Felix saves Dora's life and they become a couple. Dennis kisses Kelly's friend and his dancing partner Basin (Mila Kunis), who kisses him back, suggesting that they also begin a relationship. Kelly and Berke leave the theater after the show, looking forward to their future together as they discuss the next night's performance.

However, Edith finds out from Margaret's chauffeur (George Chandler) that the couple were childless, and becomes resentful, realising how Margaret had trapped Frank into marriage. While Margaret now enjoys a life of ease and wealth, Edith is struggling financially; her business, a cocktail lounge, is losing money and she is threatened with eviction for not paying her bills.\r\n","Later the same day, which is also the sisters' birthday, Edith rings Margaret and orders her to come over. Earlier in the evening, Edith had seen her boyfriend, police sergeant Jim Hobson (Karl Malden), when he gave her a wrist watch as a birthday present, but was hurt and puzzled because she didn't want to spend the evening with him.

The maid (Paul Henreid's daughter Monika in a small role) is puzzled when her mistress chooses not to put her very valuable jewelry in the safe, not realizing of course that Edith has no idea what the combination is. Eventually, because of her failure to imitate her sister's signature, required for papers pertaining to Frank's estate, Edith is forced to purposely burn her hand on a poker she has heated in the fire, in order to have a plausible excuse not to sign her name with her right hand.\r\n","Meanwhile, Jim visits \"Margaret\" several times, asking questions about the death of Edith, whom he loved. Edith is troubled about having to lie to Jim, who keeps commenting on the remarkable likeness between the sisters. She tries to offer him the wrist watch as a keepsake, a gesture Jim recoils from; it feels to him that \"Margaret\" is unaware of the significance of the watch, and it painfully reminds him of the birthday evening which was the last time, as far as he is concerned, that he ever saw Edith alive.\r\n","Edith's scheme runs into unforeseen trouble when she discovers that Margaret had had a lover, Tony (Peter Lawford), a louche would-be playboy who unexpectedly turns up and very quickly sees through her charade. Tony blackmails Edith over the killing of Margaret, and receives very expensive jewelry as payment. Edith then learns that Margaret and Tony had conspired to murder Frank by poisoning him with arsenic.

Jeffrey in distress of the chase, said he gave up on Amy and believes he's done nothing wrong. To which Ed, calls him a \"back-stabbing weasel\", though Jeffrey believes he's still done nothing wrong because he slept with Amy before they dated. Ed shouts out that he was engaged to Kat, proving he was still in the wrong for what he did to Kat. Nick, driving away, picks up Ed as Jeffrey disappears into the woods.\r\n","Nick and Ed talk about love, and Ed decides he loves Amy more than he is angry. To make it more clear that he should go back, Nick tells Ed if he went back the couple would end up having great make-up sex. To which, Nick helps urge him more to return to the church, so they end up getting married, with Nick as 'new' best man. Just before the ceremony, Nick tells Kat he realized he'd \"... rather fight with you than make love with anyone else\", and they kiss passionately. Kat and Nick begin a real relationship together. Amy and Kat now reconcile and Kat lets go of her anger and forgives Amy since she confessed the truth to Ed. TJ, Kat's cousin also apparently enjoys a moment with Woody after the wedding. Jeffrey, the main cause of all the trouble, learns absolutely nothing. At the end he is seen trying to get the attentions of a female neighbor.\n","\n","-------------------------------------------\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"b57600702c124580b2142568a3307961","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"5979a5bb96a0437ea50e7fa4eca04bce","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","True Genre:     thriller\n","\n","Predicted Genre: film noir\n","\n","Plot: Art dealer Henri Landru becomes infatuated with burlesque performer, Odette, who already has a lover and is only interested in Landru for money.

Residing deep within a Moon cave, where they have managed to maintain not only the remnants of a breathable atmosphere and Earth-like gravity but also a pair of gigantic spiders, the Cat-Women sport black unitards, beehive hairstyles, and elaborate cosmetics. Realizing that the remaining air in their cave will soon be gone, the Cat-Women plan to steal the expedition's spaceship, migrate to Earth, and in the words of the Cat-Women's queen, Alpha (Carol Brewster), \"We will get their women under our power, and soon we will rule the whole world\"!\r\n","Through the use of their telepathic ability, the Cat-Women have been subliminally controlling Helen Salinger (Marie Windsor), the mission navigator and only female member of the expedition. Once the expedition arrives on the Moon, the Cat-Women take complete control of Helen's mind, after which she leads the entire crew (clad in heavy spacesuits and equipped with matches, cigarettes, and a gun) to the Cat-Women's cave. Although unable to control the male minds, the Cat-Women are nevertheless able to influence the male crew through the mind-controlled Helen, their own superior intellectual abilities, and feminine wiles. As explained to Helen by the Cat-Woman named Beta (Suzanne Alexander), \"Show us their weak points. We'll take care of the rest\".\r\n","Along with telepathy, the Cat-Women have the ability to transport themselves, unseen and instantly, from place-to-place within their living space.

Having failed to exterminate them, the Cat-Women approach the men openly, using Helen to help establish friendly relations. Kip (Victor Jory), who has been suspicious throughout the encounter, confronts Alpha about the missing spacesuits, and she promises to return them in the morning. Food and drink are then brought, and private conversations between crew and Cat-Women begin. As the conversations progress (\"You're too smart for me, baby. I like 'em stupid\") the gun-wielding Kip sits alone, unable to intervene, while the Cat-Women successfully exploit the \"weak points\" of expedition commander Laird (Sonny Tufts) and the other men.\r\n","By that evening, the Cat-Women have learned how to pilot the spaceship.

Carrying three spacesuits, Alpha, Beta, and Helen make a break for the spaceship. Lambda teleports ahead to delay them, and is bludgeoned to death by Beta with a Moon rock. Kip catches up, and fires several shots, killing Alpha and Beta, but leaving Helen uninjured.

He recruits Chuck and Bomb to help him find Mighty Eagle, a giant bald eagle said to be the protector of the island, and the only bird that can fly, but who has not been seen for many years. They find Mighty Eagle on top of Bird Mountain, but he is now overweight, self-absorbed, and largely in retirement. Looking through the Mighty Eagle's binoculars, Red's group sees the pigs planting explosives around the island while the birds, probably unaware the other three are gone, are at a rave party. They realize the party was actually a cover for their plan to steal the birds' eggs. Red, Bomb, and Chuck attempt to warn the other birds and stop the pigs, but they arrive too late as the pigs escape with the eggs and their explosives destroy the village. When the birds realize what happened, they apologize to Red for not believing him, and the forgiving Red rallies them to let their anger loose and retrieve their eggs.\r\n","The birds construct a boat and sail to Piggy Island, where they find the pigs living in a walled city and Leonard, who is actually revealed to be King Mudbeard, the king of Piggy Island. Deducing the eggs are most likely in the castle at the center of the city, the birds attack and defeat the pigs by firing themselves over the walls using their gifted giant slingshot. However, when Terence attempts to launch himself into the city, he accidentally snaps the slingshot in half after pulling himself too far back. Meanwhile, Red, Chuck, and Bomb make it to the castle and find the eggs in a boiler room, where the pigs plan to cook and eat them. Mighty Eagle arrives, having watched these events through his binoculars and had a change of heart, and carries the eggs out of the castle. While the birds escape, one egg falls out and rolls back into the castle. While battling Leonard, Red learns to control his anger and distracts him long enough to retrieve the egg; the pot the pigs planned on boiling the eggs in collapses and shields Red as the pigs' reserve of explosives blows up and destroy Piggy Island. Red reunites with the other birds as the rescued egg hatches, revealing three little blue birds, and is declared a hero. He, Chuck, and Bomb are approached by Mighty Eagle, who claims that his laziness was only a ruse so the birds could find faith in themselves. Returning to Bird Island, the birds rebuild Red's house, which was destroyed by the pigs, and moved it to the middle of their village. All of the birds that have hatched sing a song to Red to thank him and enshrine him as a legendary hero, and Red lets Chuck and Bomb move in with him.\r\n","During the end credits, the pigs are revealed to survive Piggy Island's destruction, as King Mudbeard begins to make a new plan to steal the eggs, but soon does the break dance. In a mid-credits scene, the three blue birds use the rebuilt slingshot to launch themselves out to sea.\n","\n","-------------------------------------------\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"c1a98a5abe83453194147fe71aa1fb70","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"88e8943af6b849ab94f142f761e22a44","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","True Genre:     crime drama\n","\n","Predicted Genre: crime drama\n","\n","Plot: Vincent Karbone is a leading construction magnate in Philadelphia and a suspected leader of one of the city's most notorious criminal gangs.

The prime suspect is convicted murderer Deacon Markham (Barton MacLane), who first sold the antique chess set to the Waldeck brothers, after stealing it from its rightful owner. The theory is that Markham now wants the set back to sell it back to the first owner and get the money he needs to escape the country.\r\n","Markham reveals himself when holding Larry at gunpoint in his hotel room to get the white pieces from the set. Markham and his accomplice Mink (George E. Stone) hide when Sally enters the room, telling Larry she hid the pieces in his room.

After finding a wallet and showing his honesty by returning it to Eddie Roman (Steve Cochran), a vicious gangster, he is hired by Roman to be his driver. Roman tests his new driver, whom he nicknames 'Scotty,' by assuming control of his car from the back seat. Unbeknownst to Scotty, Roman has an accelerator installed in the rear passenger compartment so that he can \"take over\" the vehicle whenever he wants. This bizarre trick unnerves his new driver as well as Roman's right-hand man, Gino (Peter Lorre).\r\n","Roman reveals himself as a tough gangster by killing any competition, and even locks his wife, Lorna (Mich√®le Morgan), in her room every night to control her. Lorna goes for a drive every night at 9:30 pm, and one day she asks Scotty to take her to Havana, Cuba in exchange for $1,000. He consents and realizes that he is in love with her. When they get to Havana, they stop for a drink at a club, where Lorna is murdered with a knife while in Scotty's arms. All the evidence, including the fact that Scotty apparently purchased the knife that was used to kill Lorna earlier that day, points to Scotty being the killer, and he realizes he is being framed. The photograph from the club that proves Scotty was innocent is destroyed by Gino, who has come down to Cuba to exact revenge against Lorna and Scotty. Scotty escapes police custody, but is gunned down by Gino when he returns to the curio store where the knife came from.\r\n","Suddenly, Scotty wakes up back in Miami on the night he and Lorna are supposed to abscond to Havana. He is sweating profusely and immediately takes his pills that he is prescribed, presumably to deal with posttraumatic stress disorder from battle.

Suddenly, he arrives, bedraggled and exhausted, and begins to describe the strange experiences he has had since the group last met.\r\n","At their earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George described time as \"the fourth dimension\" to David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp. He shows them a small model time machine and asks a guest to press a tiny lever. The device disappears, validating his claim, but his friends remain unconvinced; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal.\r\n","George bids his guests a good evening, then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future to 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in a War. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping in 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \"a new war\"; George resumes his journey and stops in 1966, finding his neighborhood now part of a futuristic metropolis. People are hurrying into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover. Moments later, a nuclear explosion causes a volcanic eruption around him. George narrowly makes it back to his machine and continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly cools and hardens, trapping him inside. He travels much farther into the future until the rock eventually erodes away, revealing a lush, green, unspoiled landscape.\r\n","When George stops once again it is 802,701 and he is near the base of a towering sphinx. He goes exploring and finds a group of delicate young men and women with simple clothing gathered at a stream. One woman, carried off by the current, screams for help but none of her companions show any concern. George rescues her and is surprised when, revived, she walks away without a word; she later seeks him out and gives him a flower. She says her name is Weena and tells George her people are called the Eloi. The Eloi do not operate machines, work, or read, and know little of mankind's history.\r\n","That night, George discovers that his machine has been taken into the sphinx. Weena follows, telling him \"Morlocks\", who only come out at night, have moved it. A Morlock jumps out from behind bushes and tries to drag her away, but its light-sensitive eyes are blinded by George's fire torch. Weena has never seen fire before and nearly burns herself trying to touch the flame.\r\n","The next day, Weena shows George domed, well-like structures that dot the landscape: air shafts that double as access to the Morlock underworld. She takes him to an ancient museum where \"talking rings\" tell of a war in the distant past which lasted 326 years. A reduced population fought for survival in the poisoned landscape; many decided to live underground in permanent settlements, while some returned to the surface. George realizes this was the beginning of speciation for the Morlocks and the Eloi. He starts to climb down a shaft, but stops when sirens blare from atop the sphinx. He finds Weena gone and crowds of Eloi in a trance-like state, entering open doors at its base. The sirens stop and the doors close.\r\n","George enters the Morlocks' subterranean caverns and is horrified to see that the Eloi are the free range livestock for the Morlocks; the Morlocks are cannibals. Finding Weena, he begins fighting the Morlocks. His efforts inspire others to defend themselves. George sets fires and urges the Eloi to climb to the surface with him. He directs them to gather dry tree branches and drop them down the shafts. The fire's intensity increases and the subterranean cavern collapses.\r\n","The next morning, George finds the sphinx in charred ruins and its doors open. His time machine is inside. He enters, the doors close, and George is attacked in the dark by Morlocks. George activates his time machine, traveling back to 1900, coming to rest on the lawn outside his home, where the story had begun, and now ends.\r\n","As the bedraggled George recounts his story, his friends are again skeptical. He produces Weena's flower and Filby, an amateur botanist, says that he cannot match it with any species known in the 19th century. George bids his guests a good evening. Filby steps out but returns to find George and his time machine now gone. There are drag marks which indicate that George wanted the time machine to be positioned outside the sphinx when he returned to the future. The housekeeper notes that nothing is missing except three books that she could not identify. When the housekeeper wonders if George will ever return, Filby observes that he could not say but that \"he (George) has all the time in the world\".\n","\n","-------------------------------------------\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"b21625ad9c57497d96e4eccf8e0a346f","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"50fc0b29c16a415cb0dd4d9d031bc43d","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","True Genre:     horror\n","\n","Predicted Genre: horror\n","\n","Plot: In 2004, Broadway diva Kylie Swanson opened the musical The Haunting of the Opera (a reference to real-life musical The Phantom of the Opera) to a packed audience.

When Camilla hears that the camp will be producing a kabuki version of The Haunting of the Opera, she decides that she will sneak into auditions one way or another. She manages to convince a camper overseeing the auditions, Joel Hopton, to let her in and Camilla easily impresses the stage director Artie and wins the lead role of Sofia - much to Buddy's dismay.\r\n","As the opening day grows closer and closer, Camilla discovers that Artie will only let her perform on opening day as long as she provides him with sexual favors. He emotionally blackmails her by playing her off of Liz Silver, a camper that will do anything to perform on opening night. Camilla tries to ward off Artie's attentions by only making out with him, which disgusts Joel - whom Camilla has largely ignored since the audition. The night before the performance, Artie gives Camilla an ultimatum: either she sleeps with him or he gives the opening night performance to Liz. Camilla initially acquiesces to Artie's overtures, but decides at the last minute that she can't go through with it. After she leaves, Artie is brutally murdered by someone wearing the Opera Ghost mask, but Roger tells everyone that Artie died by car accident. Unwilling to potentially lose a visit from important Broadway agent Victor Brady, who is only willing to watch the performance if Camilla is performing, Roger manages to persuade everyone to perform opening night as planned.\r\n","That night, Joel tries to warn Camilla that Artie was killed and that the murderer is still out there, but his warnings go largely unheeded and the show begins. All seems well with the musical and Victor until later in the performance, when Opera Ghost kills campers Whitney, Sam, and Sheila, and stops Liz from taking revenge on Camilla for performing on opening night. This causes a gap in the performance, which the cast tries to fill with impromptu music and dancing while Camilla looks for her missing co-star. She instead finds an ever-increasing number of bodies.\r\n","Camilla manages to intervene when she discovers Opera Ghost trying to kill Roger. This killer is revealed to be Buddy, who says that he did it because he did not want Camilla to get involved in the acting world, which he saw as corrupt, especially. Buddy tells Camilla that Roger is the one who kill their mother in a jealous rage. He spent the 10 years trying to avenge his mother's death and he wants to kill whoever who's close to Roger. Roger knows about the truth, turns violent, manages to free himself, attacks Buddy and fatally stabs him to death. He decides to kill Camilia because her brother wants to kill Roger. Roger chases Camilia throughout the camp and corners her backstage. Just as Roger is about to kill Camilia, she finds a buzz saw and kills him and stumbles onto stage. The audience initially assumes that this was all part of the show and applauds what they believe to be the finale.\r\n","The film then cuts to the Broadway revival of The Haunting of the Opera with Camilla as the lead.

Edgar Hoover to launch retaliatory attacks against terrorists that threaten the United States. He also privately discovers Ginger is a DEA agent working undercover, and further is surprised to discover a corpse that looks like Gabriel. He goes to see Holly home from school but finds he is being followed by FBI agent J.T. Roberts (Don Cheadle), who had previously caught Stanley. Roberts, though monitoring Stanley closely, is more interested in Gabriel as he does not appear on any government database, and after learning that another hacker, Axl Torvalds (Rudolf Martin), had been killed by Gabriel's men, warns Stanley to be cautious. Stanley opts to secretly code a back door in his hydra that reverses the money transfer after a short period. Meanwhile, Senator Reisman (Sam Shepard), who oversees Black Cell, learns the FBI has started tracking Gabriel and orders him to stand down. Gabriel refuses, and narrowly avoids an assassination attempt ordered by Reisman. Gabriel personally kills Reisman in revenge and continues his plan.\r\n","Stanley delivers the hydra to Gabriel and leaves to see Holly, only to find that Gabriel has killed Melissa and her husband and kidnapped Holly, framing Stanley. Stanley has no choice but to participate in the bank heist to get Holly back. Gabriel and his men storm a Worldbanc branch, and secure its employees and customers as hostages, fitting each with ball-bearing-based explosives similar to Claymore mines. When police and FBI surround the branch, Gabriel takes Stanley to the coffee shop across the street to meet with Roberts, but Gabriel spends the time to discuss the film Dog Day Afternoon and the nature of misdirection. Once back in the bank, Gabriel has one of his men escort a hostage to demonstrate the situation. A sniper kills the man, and other agents pull the hostage away from the bank, causing the bomb to detonate, ravaging the buildings and vehicles on the street and killing several people, a scene shown in medias res at the start of the film.\r\n","Gabriel instructs Stanley to launch the hydra, and turns Holly over to him once completed. However, Stanley's back door triggers before they can leave the bank, and Stanley is recaptured while Holly is rescued. Gabriel threatens to kill Ginger, who he knows is a DEA agent, unless Stanley re-siphons the money back to a Monte Carlo bank. Despite doing so, Gabriel shoots Ginger. Gabriel and his men load the hostages on a bus and demand a plane wait for them at the local airport, but while en route, the bus is lifted off by a S-64 Aircrane and deposited on the roof of a local skyscraper. Gabriel deactivates the bombs and departs with his surviving men on a waiting helicopter, which Stanley shoots down using a rocket-propelled grenade from the bus.\r\n","Roberts takes Stanley to verify the corpse they found, believing Gabriel was a Mossad agent while there was no record of a DEA agent named Ginger. Stanley recognizes the corpse as the one he discovered earlier and personally realizes that the whole scenario was misdirection. The Police still cannot find Ginger's corpse. Gabriel had escaped a different route, and Ginger had been wearing a bulletproof vest and was working with Gabriel all along. Stanley does not tell Police that Gabriel & Ginger are still alive. Roberts arranges for Stanley to have full custody of Holly, and the two tour the US together. In Monte Carlo, Gabriel and Ginger withdraw the money, and later watch as a yacht at sea explodes. Over the film's credits, a news report describes the destruction of the yacht, carrying a known terrorist, as the third such incident in as many weeks.\n","\n","-------------------------------------------\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"0507f86fe8e5475286e044de02bc15c4","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"e6ea438bccd64f049eec7361920da10f","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","True Genre:     comedy\n","\n","Predicted Genre: mystery\n","\n","Plot: The film opens early in the twentieth century, at an English country mansion with the apparent murder of Lord and Lady Morley in their car by a figure in a black cape.

They encounter the heiress (Trisha Noble) and a questionable staff. As the two investigate the murder, each of the staff, which includes a samurai, a hunchback, a busty maid, a gypsy, and an insane butler to mention a few, are seemingly killed. However, each of their bodies disappear before the detectives can show them to the heiress. The detectives then wind up in a \"torture chamber\" (whose purpose is not explained), where Winship is caught in a deadly trap until the caped figure (\"The Shadow\") leaps out to rescue him.\r\n","A boa constrictor then frightens them into a trash compactor, where they survive being compressed into a bale of garbage. Once out of the garbage, they find the heiress taking the Morley money and preparing to leave the mansion. She then confesses to having killed the Morleys for their money as she has a gambling habit. Planning to kill the detectives and escape the mansion, she falls backward into a flower bed while retreating, where she is grabbed by the shadowy figure, who has been hiding in the dirt. The shadow scares her to the point that she faints, at which time the shadow takes off his cape, revealing himself to be Lord Morley. Morley had escaped the car crash and gathered the staff in order to gain their help in a plan to force the heiress into confessing to the murder of his wife and attempt on his own life. Lord Morley remained \"dead\" (in hiding) as part of the plan, writing the letter to Scotland Yard in order to request Winship and Tart as investigators, presumably because of their incompetence, noted early on in the film.

She encounters the aptly named Stoney (Jack Nicholson) and his hippie band \"Mumblin' Jim\" in a coffee shop. The boys are sympathetic, especially when they discover that she is deaf and can only understand others through lip reading. They hide her from the police and help her look for her brother. She has a postcard from him which reads \"Jess Saes: God is alive and well and living in a sugar cube\". The band is approached by a promoter who arranges for them to perform at \"the Ballroom\", clearly the Avalon Ballroom or the Fillmore West.\r\n","Artist Warren (Henry Jaglom), who designs the psychedelic posters advertising the band, freaks out badly in his gallery, apparently on STP. He sees everyone, including himself, as walking dead and tries to cut off his own (to him festering) hand with a circular saw. While they help him, Jenny notices a large sculpture resembling abstract flames in a corner and recognizes it as her brother's work. The gallery owner says the artist is known as \"The Seeker\", an itinerant preacher. Ex-band member Dave (Dean Stockwell) may know The Seeker's current whereabouts.\r\n","Dave left the band because he felt they were too concerned with worldly success and \"games\", rather than serious focus on music for its own sake. His information leads the gang to a junkyard. Nearby is a sign reading \"Jess Saes\" -- \"Jesus Saves\", with some letters missing. The \"sugar cube\" slogan is painted on the side of a car which Jenny recognizes as her brother's. However, a group of thugs who frequent the junkyard accost the group. They have it in for The Seeker. They dislike his street preaching and his themes of love and peace (perhaps they are Vietnam War veterans). They threaten to rape Jenny. Violence ensues, and the group barely escape with their lives.\r\n","Jenny's friendship with Stoney has become sexual. She does not know his reputation for one-night stands and lack of commitment. She attends a mock funeral staged by a large group of hippies, with background music by The Seeds; the theme of their play is that death is not the end, and that love and a refusal to hurt others are what keep us alive. In Stoney's crowded home, everyday hippie life is less than ideal. The residents are all involved in contemplation, sex, sleeping, dancing, or decorating, but little cleaning or maintenance. Jenny tries to wash the mountain of dishes in the kitchen and finds that the plumbing is broken, but everybody just continues dancing. Frustrated, she interrupts Stoney's band practice to inform him she is going to take a walk. He answers angrily that he has no leash on her. Dave, sitting quietly in the next room, is distressed at the way Stoney treats Jenny. Concerned in spite of himself, Stoney later goes to find her. He ends up at the art gallery, where he hears breaking glass and slips inside.\r\n","The Seeker (Bruce Dern) has returned to the art gallery to pick up his sculpture. Challenged by Stoney, he pleads that the work should not be touched; it is actually not art, but a shrine. He believes that God spoke to him and asked him to create the piece. He is glad Jenny is looking for him, but says he is on drugs and wants to be sober when they meet. Jenny's deafness is pathological; their mother was cruelly abusive, and burned Jenny's beloved toys. Jenny was violently traumatized and apparently had a stroke; she was deaf from that moment.\r\n","The performance at the Ballroom is a success; Mumblin' Jim play, along with the Strawberry Alarm Clock. Steve the Seeker shows up, hoping to see Jenny, but the junkyard thugs are also present and chase him back to his home. Steve runs right behind Jenny without her noticing, since she hears nothing. At an after-show party Dave remonstrates Stoney over his ambition for commercial success, as well as his cavalier treatment of Jenny. Stoney saunters off with another woman, and Dave consoles Jenny. She sees him put STP in some fruit juice. He offers himself to her, but Stoney charges in and angrily shouts at Jenny, calling her a \"bitch\". Heartbroken, Jenny accepts Dave's glass of fruit juice and drinks nearly all of it.\r\n","She again explains her search for Steve, and Dave pulls a note from his pocket: \"God is in the flame,\" and an address. Jenny runs out and takes a streetcar. Stoney rouses Dave, now tripping on STP, to help find her. Pursued by the junkyard thugs back to his home, Steve lights a fire inside his shrine. Soon the entire house is ablaze. Jenny arrives to find a crowd gathering near the house; she runs in just in time to see him standing in the middle of the flames, absorbed in prayer; he sees her, but merely smiles and waves.\r\n","In her grief and confusion, she runs up to the roof, hallucinating wildly. She apparently jumps into a reservoir. She then sees fire bombs heading towards her barely missing her. Gary Kent, the film's stunt coordinator, did double duty creating this and other special effects in the film. [3] She is standing in the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge, cars coming at her from both directions with their horns blaring. She has her hands over her ears, indicating perhaps that she has regained her hearing. Dave and Stoney find her. Dave shoves her out of the way of an oncoming car and is struck and killed. As he dies, he murmurs that he hopes this, too, will be a good trip. Sickened and angry, Jenny tries to leave, but Stoney embraces her. The film ends with the two holding each other and crying, while an image of the mock funeral reappears.\n","\n","-------------------------------------------\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"16fa8879ed6b499191a58ba04d3c16b3","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"59773578faa04802a386a9d140694031","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","True Genre:     adventure\n","\n","Predicted Genre: adventure\n","\n","Plot: A man tries to enforce the law in a rowdy South African diamond-mining town.\n","\n","-------------------------------------------\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"fad5430d46bf49159ab81d392f190777","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"dab82bd21bd54df180bddd231b98d63f","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","True Genre:     science fiction\n","\n","Predicted Genre: science fiction\n","\n","Plot: After a government agency makes first contact with aliens in 1961, alien refugees live in secret on Earth, mostly disguised as humans in the New York metropolitan area.

The United Kingdom is ruled as a Nordic supremacist[6][7][8] and neo-fascist[9] police state by the Norsefire Party, helmed by all-powerful High Chancellor Adam Sutler. Political opponents, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, atheists, homosexuals, and other \"undesirables\" are imprisoned and executed in concentration camps. The Irish are not exterminated, but are considered inferior compared to people of Nordic and British descent.[6]\r\n","On November 4, a vigilante in a Guy Fawkes mask identifying himself as \"V\" rescues Evey Hammond, an employee of the state-run British Television Network, from members of the \"Fingermen\" secret police while she is out past curfew. From a rooftop, they watch his demolition of London's main criminal court, the Old Bailey, accompanied by fireworks and the \"1812 Overture\". Inspector Finch of Scotland Yard is asked to investigate V's activities while BTN declares the incident an \"emergency demolition\". V interrupts the broadcast to claim responsibility, encouraging the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on next year's Guy Fawkes Night outside the Houses of Parliament. During the broadcast, the police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape, but is knocked unconscious.\r\n","V takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V then kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the Bishop of London. Evey offers to help, and uses the opportunity to escape to the home of her boss, comedian and talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him with her safety, Gordon reveals prohibited materials, including subversive paintings, an antique Quran, and homoerotic photographs. Meanwhile, V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who had experimented on him and many other \"undesirables\" 20 years ago at Larkhill concentration camp; seeing her remorse for her past actions, he kills her painlessly.\r\n","After Gordon performs a satire of the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is imprisoned and tortured for information about V, with her only solace being a note written by actress Valerie Page, a former prisoner who was tortured and killed for her lesbianism. Evey is told she will be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is inexplicably released, and then finds herself in V's home. It turns out that V was the one who had \"captured\" her at Gordon's home, and staged her imprisonment and torture to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He also informs her that Deitrich had been executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realises she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.\r\n","Reading the deceased Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and has been targeting the people who detained him. Despite being stonewalled by the government, Finch searches for the true identity of V, tracing him to a bioweapons program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him that the program, which was directed by Sutler (who was then Undersecretary of Defence), resulted in the creation of the deadly St. Mary's Virus. He further reveals that Creedy, a leader of the Norsefire Party, released the virus onto English soil, killing 100,000 British residents and framing the outbreak as an attack by a terrorist organisation. The Party, which promised security in times of social instability, used the ensuing wave of fear to elevate Sutler to the newly created office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in Parliament, becoming the elected government. Finch later discovers that Rookwood was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in the Norsefire government is severely shaken.\r\n","As November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks, and the population questions party rule as the nation slowly descends into anarchy, ignited when one of the Fingermen makes the mistake of shooting and killing a young girl committing vandalism, only to be killed in turn by a mob of enraged citizens. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her an explosive-laden train in the abandoned London Underground, set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Party Leader Creedy, with whom he has made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal and kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, he returns to Evey and tells her he loves her before dying.\r\n","As Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train off. On the surface, thousands of unarmed Londoners wearing Guy Fawkes masks march towards Parliament. Since Creedy and Sutler are both dead, the military receives no orders, and allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, \"He was all of us.\"\n","\n","-------------------------------------------\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"120252256ca54e61b96f940298716924","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"aa2181b6068c4ac9a5b007e59c4aebc0","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, max=1.0), HTML(value='')))"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","True Genre:     action\n","\n","Predicted Genre: science fiction\n","\n","Plot: The film is set in the end-times, or The Great Tribulation, after the rapture, when the earth has been taken over, and the mark of the Beast - an implant in the right hand or forehead - is being imposed on everyone worldwide.
